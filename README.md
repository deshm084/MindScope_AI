## 📋 Overview
MindScope is a **multimodal deep learning system** designed to detect early signals of mental health risk by fusing structured patient history with unstructured clinical notes.

While traditional models rely solely on survey checkboxes, MindScope uses a **Late-Fusion Architecture** to analyze the *context* of a patient's words (using DistilBERT) alongside their clinical metrics (TabNet-style dense network).

### Key Metrics (Synthetic Data)
* **Validation Accuracy:** ~95.8%
* **F1-Score (Weighted):** ~0.955
* **Inference Latency:** <45ms (via ONNX/FastAPI)

---

## 🏗️ Architecture
The system processes data through two parallel "towers" before fusing representations for the final classification:

1.  **NLP Tower:** * **Input:** Unstructured text (e.g., "I feel hopeless and can't sleep.")
    * **Model:** `DistilBERT-base-uncased` (Fine-tuned).
    * **Output:** 768-dim semantic vector.
2.  **Tabular Tower:** * **Input:** Normalized features (Age, Sleep, Stress).
    * **Model:** Dense Network with **Batch Normalization**.
    * **Output:** 32-dim feature vector.
3.  **Fusion Layer:**
    * Concatenates vectors $[V_{nlp}, V_{tab}]$ -> Dense Layer -> Softmax -> Risk Probability.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Generate Data & Train
To respect patient privacy, this repository generates synthetic "Gold Standard" data.

Bash

# Generate synthetic dataset
python -m src.data_gen

# Train the fusion model
python -m src.train
Best model saved to: models/mindscope_best.pth

3. Run the Production API (Microservice)
Launch the FastAPI server to generate real-time risk assessments.

Bash

uvicorn api.app:app --reload
Swagger UI: Open http://localhost:8000/docs to test the API interactively.

Sample Request:

JSON

{
  "clinical_note": "Patient reports insomnia and feelings of worthlessness.",
  "age": 45,
  "sleep_hours": 3.5,
  "stress_level": 9,
  "family_history": 1
}
4. Run Unit Tests
Validate model architecture and tensor shapes before deployment.

Bash

🛠️ Engineering Decisions
Decision	Rationale
Late Fusion	Handles mixed modalities (Text vs. Numbers) without forcing a single joint feature space too early, allowing each tower to specialize.
DistilBERT	Retains 97% of BERT's performance while being 40% smaller—critical for low-latency clinical dashboards.
Batch Normalization	Stabilizes the learning of tabular features (Age 0-100 vs. Sleep 0-24) so they aren't overpowered by high-dimensional text gradients.
Microservice (API)	Inference logic is wrapped in FastAPI with Pydantic validation, making the model Docker-ready for Azure/AWS deployment.
